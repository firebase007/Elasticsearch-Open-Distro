### Open Distro with Elasticsearch

Open Distro allows users to interact with an ES cluster with SQL and to perform operations for which you would normally have to use the Elasticsearch domain-specific language (DSL). This feature was initially based on the elasticsearch-sql plugin, which is now being gradually phased out or deprecated.

In this tutorial, our focus is on how to query Elasticsearch data using SQL with the help of this open-source tool. We are going to cover:
